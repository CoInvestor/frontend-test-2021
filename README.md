# Frontend developer test

The test took me roughly 1 hour to complete. I created a custom axios/fetch hook so i could use repeatable code to fetch data without repeating it. The page is fully responsive. I've also added a search function so the user can filter through the data. You can click any card which directs you to a page with more information about user.
